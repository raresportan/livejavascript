            <p>
                Did you ever wanted to learn JavaScript, but never had the chance to see what is it about?
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you watch a bunch of videos about JavaScript, but when is time to write some code,
                everything is kind of confusing?
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you read a book or two about JavaScript, but got sidetracked in endless details you don't
                care about?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you feel you should know JavaScript by now, but still find yourself browsing StackOverflow for
                trivial how-tos?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you have any clue about what good JavaScript code is? And how to avoid the foot guns?

                <p>At the core of all these is JavaScript. How far can you go till the lack of
                    JavaScript knowledge will be a problem?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What happens when you know React, Angular, Vue or Svelte and need to fix some Node.js code?
                    Or the other way around? You run away?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good JavaScript developer is a full stack developer by default.
                    Any good codebase keeps the core logic away from the framework boilerplate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not even TypeScript can save you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coding in TypeScript without knowing JavaScript is a bit dangerous.
                    The code looks similar to other typed languages, like Java or C# so people
                    expect it to work in the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it doesn't. JavaScript is no Java or C#.

                <h3>It's just you and a code editor</h3>
                <em>No videos, no lengthy texts.</em>
                <p>
                    Each lesson has a big upfront comment that explains you what is
                    the lesson about, how a particular feature works or what you
                    have to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then there is a piece of code that shows the feature in action.
                    The code is executed on the fly and is editable. You are
                    expected to tinker with it to better understand how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, there are exercises that can be solved using the knowledge gained in the lesson.
                </p>
            </div>
        </article>

                <p>
                    Experiment freely, code changes and preferences are saved locally in your browser,
                    nothing is sent over the network.
                </p>
                <h3>Infinite loop protection</h3>
                <p>
                    Since code is executed on the fly, while you're typing it,
                    is possible to reach an infinite loop state, e.g. when using
                    while or for loop. Don't worry, the code execution will stop
                    and the browser will not block.
                </p>
                <h3>Light & Dark themes</h3>
                <p>
                    Do you preffer a light or a dark theme? We got you covered in both cases.

                <p>
                    Every few lessons, a simple quiz will wait for you.
                    You answer to a question by choosing one of two pieces of code,
                    the correct one or the wrong one.
                </p>

                <h3>Boss Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    If you could accept some challenges... That would be great!
                </p>

                <h3>Small Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    In which you are given the complete source code of a small
                    project like "Hangman" game, "No more secrets" effect or
                    "Sprite map generator" algorithm.

        <h2>How it feels to write JavaScript?</h2>
        <div style="column-count: 2;">
            <p>
                Some will say terrible things about JavaScript.<br />
                Some of these things are true.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you write something in JavaScript for the first time,
                you can quickly despise it.
            </p>
            <p>
                It will accept almost anything you typed but interpret it in a way
                that was completely different from what you meant.
            </p>
            <p>
                This, of course, means that you don't have a clue what are you doing,
                but the real issue is that
                <em>JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial idea was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier
                for beginners. In reality, finding problems is harder
                because nothing will point them out to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                It will just try to make sense from what you tell it to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this flexibility has its advantages though:
                It leaves space for a lot of techniques that are impossible
                in more rigid languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>After learning the language properly and working with it for a while,
                    the chances are you will actually love JavaScript.</em>
            </p>

                    <br /><br />
                    Most of these years I've been programming in JavaScript. And I still enjoy doing that.
                    <br /><br />
                    I love simple and straight code that creates fast and reliable software. Maybe too much.
