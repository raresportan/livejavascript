How to make metaphors:

1. Identify the nouns and verbs 
   What things and actions do you need to explain

2. State it in simple, high-level terms
   Look for physical properties and categories

3. Focus on key functions and qualities to highlight
   What's important and what's not?

4. Think literally to find alternative
   Look at unrelated disciplines
